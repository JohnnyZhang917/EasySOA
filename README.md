## Introduction

#### EasySOA builds on the web and Open Source technologies to make Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) simpler to use.

Its goal is to add an **open**, **light**, **agile** layer on top of « traditional » SOA, thanks to an **online**, **social** and **collaborative** approach, involving **all actors** of the SOA process. Beyond cartography and documentation, it helps gathering and fast-prototyping the business needs, and eases the transition to final implementations in the existing SOA solution.

Driven by a consortium of [major actors](http://www.easysoa.org/welcome/easysoa-consortium/) of the Open Source community, EasySOA has already started [throttling up](http://www.easysoa.org/welcome/partner-entreprises/) the SOA engine in the enterprise. Why not yours ?
