# EasySOA

## Introduction

EasySOA is an ambitious Open Source project, which aims at making Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) simpler to use.

The goal is to add a light, agile layer on top of the « traditional » SOA, thanks to an online, social and collaborative approach, involving all actors of the SOA process. It helps gathering and fast-prototyping the business needs, and eases the transition to final implementations in the existing SOA solution. All of this using the web!
