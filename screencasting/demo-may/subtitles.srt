00:00:04,749 --> 00:00:09,749
Welcome ! Let's show you some
EasySOA Core & Light features.

2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,190
First, we are going to explore out
intranet to look for web services.

3
00:00:25,821 --> 00:00:30,821
We just found one of our company's
services. Let's save it to see what we can do.

4
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:41,605
Note that a few business tags were
extracted from the navigation context.

5
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:54,268
Our "Pure Air Flowers" service has
just been saved!

6
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,469
Next, we are going to explore another
part of EasySOA Core.

7
00:01:07,274 --> 00:01:12,274
Here is our service registry,
based on Nuxeo.

8
00:01:19,838 --> 00:01:24,838
All of the information that was
collected is stored here.

9
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:30,066
Now let's browse to our new service.

10
00:01:34,283 --> 00:01:39,283
Most of these metadata can be
overriden, for exemple to store
some documentation.

11
00:01:39,427 --> 00:01:44,427
For technical users, there is also
more technical content you can browse.

12
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,470
New, what about this "Call it" button?

13
00:02:01,786 --> 00:02:06,786
This link lead to this page, when
we can indeed use the service!

14
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:11,831
This form was automatically generated
to fit the service implementation.

15
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:14,581
Let's give a try.

16
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:18,631
Behind the scenes, the service is
proxied, so that the calls are secured.

17
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:24,000
If you use the service excessively
(here 10 times in 2mn), your won't be
able to call it again before 2 minutes!

18
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:29,364
Of course, that's just a part of what
EasySOA will be able to do...
Thanks for watching!
