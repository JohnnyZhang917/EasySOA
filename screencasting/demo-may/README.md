This .osp project has been created with *OpenShot Video Editor*, under Ubuntu.

    sudo apt-get install openshot openshot-doc
    
Note that the project file stores links to its resources in absolute path, so you will need to use 'ln -fs' or a replace function on DemoMay.osp. You will also need the video file, which is not included here.

The subtitles (edited with *gnome-subtitles*) can't be embedded using OpenShot, but *Avidemux* can do that.

    sudo apt-get install avidemux gnome-subtitles
