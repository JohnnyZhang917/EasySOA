This project has been built on "OpenShot Video Editor"

    sudo apt-get install openshot openshot-doc
   
You will also need `ScreencastingRaw.ogv`, which is not included here.

Note that the project file stores links to its resources in absolute path, so you will need to use 'ln -fs' or a replace function on DemoMay.osp. DIY!
