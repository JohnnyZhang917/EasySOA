## TODO


## Scenario list

OK scaffolder calling a service selected (in accessible environments)
OK scaffolder calling a mock
OK scaffolder, then (from called service in this environment) create mock, by replace (or LATER fork)

OK scaffolder, then in between add WS monitoring proxy
OK then record exchanges (autostart, reset(), save(name), restore(name))
OK then create mock using a named recorded session of exchanges (when a given request appears, return the response)

OK then create template UI impl to replace scaffolder (LATER impl rather linked or forked from other env)
OK then add WS proxy + js impl between template UI and mock
OK then record exchanges and let the user tailor a recording session that is a test suite
OK then setup test suite to be called on each js impl changes
