    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    
    Welcome to <b>EasySOA</b> Core & Light!
    
    <h1><b>First time user</b>? Take the tour!</h1>
   
   <div class="tabber">

      <div class="tabbertab" title="For the Business user">
          
          <p><b>Note:</b> Before using this demo, please set your browser's HTTP proxy to <b>localhost:8081</b> (enable only the HTTP protocol) and remove any proxy exceptions. In case something goes wrong during the demo, you can check the <a href="https://github.com/easysoa/EasySOA/wiki/Demo-v0.3-doc#wiki-troubleshooting">troubleshooting page</a>.</p>
           
          <h2><div>Step 1</div> Discover services in your intranet</h2>
          
          <div class="loginInfoBox"><img src="img/users/bu.png" style="vertical-align: middle" />
          In order to login as a <b>Business User</b>, use <b>Sophie</b> as username/password.</div>
          
          <p><a class="more" href="http://github.com/easysoa/EasySOA/wiki/Discovery-by-Browsing">More on discovery by browsing</a>For tests purposes, this demo packs a mockup intranet of a company named <i>Pure Air Flowers</i>. Let's browse it using the <a href="core/index.html">Service Discovery</a>. From there, as you visit pages, you will see services appearing in the left menu, meaning that EasySOA has just found them. You're then two clicks away to register this service: just select <b>"Orders service"</b>, then click <b>"Save Service"</b>, and you're done!</p>

          <h2><div>Step 2</div> Explore all services</h2>
          
          <p><a class="more" href="http://github.com/easysoa/EasySOA/wiki/The-service-registry">More on the service registry</a>Now, let's have a look to our registered services. You will find them in the <a href="http://localhost:8080/nuxeo">Service Registry</a>. Once you're logged in, navigate to <i>Workspaces > Service Registry</i>. You will find here a <b>"Default Application"</b> document what you've just registered. If you open the <b>"Orders service"</b> service, all metadata are now here, business and technical (since you're logged as a business user, you'll have to unfold the "Technical information" block to see its data, but everything is here). You can edit everything, and add more information if you want to document your service.</p>
          
          <p>Now what about some communication with other users? More than allowing service documentation to be collaborative, the registry provides real social features. Explore the tabs above your service. You can:<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;- Add comments, to talk with other users about the service (try to post a bug report to the developers!)<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;- Start a <a href="http://doc.nuxeo.com/display/DMDOC/Starting+a+workflow">workflow</a><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;- View the document changes history, etc.</p>

          <h2><div>Step 3</div> Call a service</h2>
          
          <p>Thanks to EasySOA, the service you've just found can be easily called. While you're on the service registry, notice the <b>"Call it!"</b> button on your service page. Click it! The interface you now see has been generated from the registered definition (<i>WSDL</i>) of the service. Here you can enter the input parameters, and start a request.</p>
          
          <p>The services calls are actually made in an SOA sandbox that <b>proxies, monitors and protects</b> actual services. In this case, it prevents the user from using them excessively. You can test it by calling the service repeatedly : an error comes once you've called the service more than 10 times in 2 minutes. The calls are then blocked for 2 more minutes! ...And if you call a service more than 10 times a second, EasySOA electrocutes you (just kidding).</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <p>This should have gotten you a glimpse of what we mean by making EasySOA a "light", "open" and "collaborative" solution. All features you just tried here work out of the box, since all data used to fill the registry are discovered through the use of a simple browser.</p>
          
          <p>Right know, EasySOA is a demo provided with all imaginable disclaimers... But later, lots of features will be added, from the creation of custom services to an all-in-one architecture.</p>
          
          <div class="loginInfoBox">For more advanced features, including services monitoring and architecture files import, please see the second demo scenario.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="tabbertab" title="For Developers & IT staff">
				  
          <p>This scenario is based on another demo SOA, called "Smart Travel". This time, we will take the role of a developer who wants to map the SOA contents.</p>
          
          <h2><div>Step 1</div> Import the SOA architecture</h2>
          
          <div class="loginInfoBox"><img src="img/users/architect.png" style="vertical-align: middle" />
          In order to login as a <b>Software architect</b>, type <b>Ted</b> as username/password.</div>
          
          <p><a class="more" href="http://github.com/easysoa/EasySOA/wiki/Importing-an-SCA-Model">More on SCA import</a>First, we are going to import the whole SOA architecture into the service registry. In order to do that, a feature called "<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Component_Architecture">SCA</a> import</i>" is able to analyze the definition of the SOA components. From the service registry, create a new application by going to the "<i>Service registry</i>" document and choosing "<i>New Application Implementation</i>" ; create it with "<b>Smart Travel</b>" as the title and "<b>http://localhost</b>" for the services URL. Then, import the SCA file through the "EasySOA > SCA data import" page, from the top menu. Choose the file located in "<i>examples/smart-travel-mock-services.composite</i>" (in your EasySOA folder), then select the newly created application for the import, and go!</p>
          
          <h2><div>Step 2</div> Explore the services</h2>
          
          <p>You can now browse through various services in the left menu (you might need to click on its refresh icon). All the imported data can be useful to help developers and architects, even more once documentation files are attached to the services (you can do it by editing any document). All of the collaborative features are again available.</p>
          
          <p>Now, what if a member of the IT staff wants to know what really happens on the network?</p>
          
          <h2><div>Step 3</div> SOA Monitoring</h2>
          
          <div class="loginInfoBox"><img src="img/users/itstaff.png" style="vertical-align: middle" />
          In order to login as a member of the <b>IT Staff</b>, type <b>Arnold</b> as username/password.</div>
          
          <p><a class="more" href="http://github.com/easysoa/EasySOA/wiki/Discovery-by-monitoring">More on discovery by monitoring</a>In EasySOA, HTTP monitoring can be used both to discover new services, and simply to monitor the information system. You will eventually have the possibility to set up monitoring probes anywhere. For now, EasySOA embeds a simple HTTP monitoring proxy. You can test this feature either by using a <b>"Call it!"</b> button from the registry, or by using the direct link to the Service scaffolder, on the left of this page. All requests you will send will be intercepted by the embedded proxy, that will then send information about this service to the Service Registry. <i>(Note: make sure to type a number when a field asks for it)</i></p>
          
          <h2><div>Step 4</div> Explore the service Pt. 2: data correlation</h2>
          
          <p>Notice that thanks to monitoring and SCA import, we get two different ways to find the same services, allowing to gathering complementary information. If you add to them the discovery by browsing tool (see demo scenario #1), they all turn into an interesting way to gather crss-cutting data regarding the information system. In the service registry, the correlation between these discovery methods is represented by three icons shown on every document page: <img src="img/dtBrowsing.png" style="height: 12px" /> <img src="img/dtMonitoring.png" style="height: 12px" /> <img src="img/dtImport.png" style="height: 12px" />. For exemple, browse to the "Create Summary" service to see how these icons are enabled for the browsing and monitoring discovery. There, you will also see that the technical "call count" property has been increased!</p>
          
          <h2><div>Step 5</div> The dashboard</h2>
          
          <p><a class="more" href="http://github.com/easysoa/EasySOA/wiki/Services-dashboard">More on the dashboard</a>Since we are storing in EasySOA how many times each service has been called, why not have a way to provide all these information on a synthetic page? The dashboard, available from the top menu, allows you to organize various widgets on the same page. One of those widgets (in the <b>Utilities</b> category) is called <b>"Service Stats"</b>. Add it to see a list of services showing how many called has been made on each one.</p>
          
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <p>These two demos show you various ways to use and interact with EasySOA and its cross-cutting model. But the ambitions of EasySOA go further than what you just saw: services creation, more collaborative features, but also the configuration of the monitoring component, an all-in-one architecture... So stay tuned! Thanks for testing EasySOA!</p>
