# Prerequisites

If you are using a virtual machine, make sure its RAM is 1GB+.

# Install

Use either of these scripts to install EasySOA:

## Linux

* `install_from_scp.sh` : For VMs. Downloads the archive through SCP (the script needs to be edited to suit your configuration)
* `install_from_tgz.sh` : Installs from any EasySOA archive in the same directory
* `install_from_sources.sh` : Downloads and build the sources. Git and [Buildr][1] are needed.

## Windows
