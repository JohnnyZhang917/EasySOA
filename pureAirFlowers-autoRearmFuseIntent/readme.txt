A fuse intent demo for Frascati.

The fuse intent can be configured to accept a defined number of request in a given period of time. If the received number of requests exceed the max request number, the fuse block and do not accept more requests.
The fuse auto-rearm while no requests are received in the defined time period.

This intent can only work with a Frascati executable project.

Frascati 1.4 is required to run this software.
