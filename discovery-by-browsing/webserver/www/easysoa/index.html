    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    
    Welcome to <b>EasySOA</b> Core & Light!
    
    <h1><b>First time user</b>? Take the tour!</h1>
    
    <h2>"What do you want to do / Now you can..."</h2>
    
    <p>0. First time user - discover services in the demo mockup intranet
    1. Discover services in your own intranet
    2. Look up known services in the registry
    3. (Get business data or do a business operation using a protected /
    sandboxed / guarded service)</p>
  
    <h2>discover services in the demo mockup intranet</h2>
    
    <p>"For test purpose, this demo
packs a mockup intranet of a company named Pure Aire Flowers. Let's
browse it."
-> services list page
service detected "A service has been detected !" select it "See url,
business info (application, name)" entour√©s de rouge / zoom....
"now you can (adjust infos and) register it in nuxeo"
(TOOO nuxeo auth : cacher ???)</p>

    <h2>nuxeo</h2>

    <p>wsdl sent to nuxeo rouge / zoom...
    "let's have a look at the registered service" refresh -> "all metadata
    are now here, business and technical (WSDL)"
    ("also on another example" tagging & other additional features TODO
    discovery / override, nuxeo change impl url, search)</p>

    <h2>call</h2>
    
    <p>"Now you can use it to get business data or do a business operation" (it
    = a protected / sandboxed / guarded service)
    ("let's look up the service using search")
    "just click the 'Call it' button"
    "This interface has been generated from the registered definition of the
    service"
    "Here you can enter the input parameters, example..."
    "Let's call it..." "here we got the answer !"
    "This call is actually made through a proxy layer that prevents from
    excessive / unlimited / unbounded / unlawful / impairing use."
    "Here's the proof :"
    clic clic clic (flashes) error
    "We've called it more than 10 times in 2 minutes, now our calls are
    blocked for the remaining 2 minutes."
    "and if you actually call a service more than 10 times a second EasySOA
    even electrocutes you."
    "(Just kidding.)"</p>

    <h2>conclusion</h2>

    <p>For now, EasySOA is a demo provided with all imaginable disclaimers.
(TODO later not a demo : true generation, all in one architecture...)
(In the next 2 years / )further, EasySOA aims at... / For other people
(devs, exploit), EasySOA...
Next features will target REST services, cloud, monitoring
Partners are / built using / lotsa thanks to...</p>
