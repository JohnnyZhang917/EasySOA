# Video conversion helpers

Optimized for Open Wide's screencasting process:

1. Recording with "Desktop Recorder" on Ubuntu
2. Conversion to AVI with `ogvToAvi.sh` for use with any video editor
3. Conversion to FLV with pseudo-streaming enabled with [BinKit](http://rodrigopolo.com/about/wp-stream-video/ffmpeg-binary-installers-for-win-mac-and-linux)

The only dependency is `ffmpeg`:

     sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
