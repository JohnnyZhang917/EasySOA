To run this mock : mvn -Prun.

This mock is a modified copy of the meteo-sca-backup to avoid problems due to differences with WSDL signatures (One reason is that FraSCAti ignore JAXWS annotations). 

Given the original WSDL from "http://www.webservicex.net/globalweather.asmx?WSDL", java classes were generated by CXF.

A Server class with a main method creates an instance of the web service implementation class and publish it to the given endpoint.
