To build this mock : mvn assembly:assembly

To launch the mock : 
- Unzip the generated zip "easysoa-meteo-sca-backup-1.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.zip" un a folder and unzip it.
- Go to the bin directory
- Execute the following command : java -jar easysoa-meteo-sca-backup-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar http://localhost:9020/WeatherService

-------

This mock is a modified copy of the meteo-sca-backup to avoid problems due to differences with WSDL signatures (One reason is that FraSCAti ignore JAXWS annotations). 

Given the original WSDL from "http://www.webservicex.net/globalweather.asmx?WSDL", java classes were generated by CXF.

A Server class with a main method creates an instance of the web service implementation class and publish it to the given endpoint.

-----

Remark : In this case, it is not possible to run the mock with FraSCAti because FraSCAti doesn't works with the JAXWS annotations.
So when you have to work with CXF generated classes from a WSDL, you have at least one problem :
- The port name generated by FraSCAti don't match with the one from the wsdl because FraSCAti add the suffix 'Port'.
