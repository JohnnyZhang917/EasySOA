/**
 * Scaffolding proxy. Started with FraSCAti and Velocity
 * 
 * Goal is to :
 * - generate dynamically html form from a WSDL file.
 * - generate dynamically input and output xml schemas from WSDL
 * - publish a rest/soap proxy to establish a data exchange between the HTML form and the remote WSDl service. This proxy must be generic.
